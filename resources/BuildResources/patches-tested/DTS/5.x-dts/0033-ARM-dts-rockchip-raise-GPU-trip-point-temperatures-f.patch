Subject: [PATCH 33/54] ARM: dts: rockchip: raise GPU trip point temperatures
 for veyron
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The values match those used by the downstream Chrome OS 3.14
kernel, the 'official' kernel for veyron devices. Keep the critical
trip point for speedy at 90Â°C as in the downstream configuration.
